Do you need a way for users to upload files to your .NET Core 3 app, and to track what they've uploaded in the past? This is a Razor Class Library that provides this capability using [DropzoneJS](https://www.dropzonejs.com/) and Azure blob storage integration in a single UI. The Nuget package is **AO.AzureUploadPortal.RCL**.
